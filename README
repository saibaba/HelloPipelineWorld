Description:
------------

Here is a simple configuration for leanring BRM pipeline concepts.
It is a simple Hello World configuration.

This is what the pipeline does:
1) Takes input file (HELLO_*.cdr format) from the data/in  folder (the file contains list of users separated by newline with each user detials in the format "name;salutation")
2) Creates a new output file in data/out/hello (HELLO_*.out format) folder with a greeting
3) It uses just two framework modules: Input Generic Stream (to read the CDR) and Output Generic Stream (to generate the output)

Install
-------

1) Extract the contents of hello.tar.tz inside the $IFW_HOME folder
2) cd hello

In the hello folder you see all the configuration necessary to compute the greeting! Most important one is hello.reg.
This configuration does not depend on any external configurations (like global containerDesc file) - all it requires is locally in the hello folder.

Run
---

While in the hello folder:
1) Run the pipeline in the background with this command:
   ../bin/ifw -r hello.reg &
2) create an input file with the following command:
   echo "Saibaba;Mr" > data/in/HELLO_1.cdr
3) wait few seconds
4) Run below command to see the output:
   cat data/out/hello/HELLO_1.out

You can also see the log folder for details; Use the semaphore to control the pipeline.
